Noto Sans CJK 1.004 Release Notes
=================================

June 15, 2015

- Restore correct vertical Japanese Kana forms

The vertical kana glyphs that are made accessible via the 'vert' GSUB feature were
inadvertently reverted to their Version 1.000 forms (except for those that were added in
Version 1.002, meaning CIDs 65496 through 65505) in Version 1.002, which affected CIDs
65166 through 65251, 65256 through 65258, 65260 through 65352, 65354 through 65369, and
65471 through 65484. The correct forms, which were present in Version 1.001, are now
included.

See HISTORY for prior release notes.
