Noto CJK fonts

Noto Serif CJK 2.000 was released on 25 October 2021. We are working on Noto Serif CJK 2.001 to fix naming issues discovered by @LiliCharlie. This update will arrive the week of 1 November 2021. 

We moved the release history and other notes into both Sans and Serif so they are separate now. Please look for them there.
